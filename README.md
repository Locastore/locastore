## Usage

- From the landing page, a user enters their location (e.g., 'san francisco', '83642', etc.) in the search bar. The browser will display a results page with local businesses of all types from that geography.
- To narrow the search results to a specific business type or product, the user may enter a keyword (e.g., 'flowers', 'clothing', etc.) in the 'Search Local Retailers' search bar of this results page. The browser will display local businesses from the user's geography which relate to the keyword search.
- The user may click on a business that interests them to view details (hours, website, and photos).
- If the user has set up a profile and logged in, the user may click on a 'Favorite' button to add a business to their list of favorite businesses, which can be viewed from the home page under 'Profile'.
- When a user is done browsing, they can logout.
